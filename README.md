# Machine-Learning-for-Dummies
Welcome to Machine Learning for Dummies! This repository is for anyone interested in learning how to build machine learning models in Python from scratch. I cover essential ML concepts with clear, easy-to-follow examples. Letâ€™s dive into machine learning with Python and make it accessible to everyone!

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that lets computers learn from data and make decisions or predictions without explicit programming. This repository is designed for beginners and will help you understand fundamental ML concepts while building your own models using Python.

Setup and Requirements
To get started, make sure you have Python and essential libraries installed. I recommend using Anaconda or pip for setting up your environment.
pip install -r requirements.txt
